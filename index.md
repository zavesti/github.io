zavesti.com has been bringing together the creative community since 2015. We celebrate books, stories, entrepreneurs, artists and all visionary work. 

zavesti.com was founded as a book review service. We review books, and interview the brightest and best authors. Our book review service is one of the most trusted in the industry.

While continuing to work with book writers, we also work with other creatives such as illustrators, vloggers and entrepreneurs.
